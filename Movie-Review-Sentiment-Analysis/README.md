# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This is the capstone project completed for Udacity's machine learning engineer nanodegree in March 2017.

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [BeatufulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc)
- [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)
- [NLTK data](http://www.nltk.org/data.html)
- [Genism](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [keras](https://keras.io/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

The project used data from the following link
 - http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/

The following jupyter notebooks are prepared for the project.

- 1clean_preprocess_data.ipynb: clean and preprocess data

- 2bw_clf.ipynb: train a bag-of-words model, convert the data into numbers using the bag-of-words model, and train classification models with the converted data

- 3w2v.ipynb: train word2vec models and explore the models

- 4averaging_clf.ipynb: convert the data using word2v models and the “averaging” method, and train classification models with the converted data. 

- 4cluster_clf.ipynb: convert the data using the chosen word2v model and the “clustering” method, and train classification models with the converted data

- 4sequence_lstm.ipynb: convert the data to sequence of vectors generated by the word2v model, and train LSTM models with the converted data
